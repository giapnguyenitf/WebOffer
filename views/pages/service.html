Multiple signups shall be grounds for immediate termination of all involved accounts. Signing up multiple times from the same computer also constitutes fraud. gearmobi will file charges for recovery of any earnings received from multiple signups.

          <p class="row-content">
            At gearmobi, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use gearmobi's services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.
            <br>
            The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address.

            Some of our services require you to register for an account. gearmobi asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, e-gold account and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we may request credit card or other payment information, which we maintain in encrypted form on our server.
